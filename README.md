# Creative Resistance workshop

The foundation of the Collective's formation, the **Creative Resistance Workshop** is designed to bring artists working with technology together in small groups to talk through notions of creative resistance and critical art practice. Through a series of guided writing exercises and intimate group discussions, participants evaluate foundational assumptions around what "resistance" looks like in media art, the ups and downs of strategies and technologies engaged, and where critical practice might contribute to the power hierarchies it seeks to dismantle. Participants then collaborate to draft a manifesto detailing practical commitments and desired changes in the media art landscape for a more equitable and just technological future.  

The materials for the workshop can be downloaded from this repository and are freely available for anyone to use. There are only two requirements if you choose to do so:

1) compensate your participants if you have the means to do so â€” whether that's financially or in kind;  
2) contribute your final manifesto(s) to the [STC GitHub Repository](https://github.com/strategictransparency/manifesto) when you're done. If you need help doing this, email hello@strategictransparencycollective.net.

*The Creative Resistance Workshop was first developed as part of Eyebeam's [Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future](https://www.eyebeam.org/rapid-response/) fellowship in the summer of 2020.*
