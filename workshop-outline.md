## Explain workshop format:
- Guided writing and discussion about individual practices (bulk of session)
	- This is a free write. Don't think too much about it. Less interested in curated, polished responses that we are so used to, and more interested in stream of consciousness and what comes to mind immediately.
	- ** Keep note of things others say that strike you/feel common/resonate, we'll be coming back to them later
- Collaborative manifesto writing

Stack format for discussion: if you would like to contribute, type "stack" into the chat and I will call on people in the order that they have sent it. This ensures an egalitarian discussion and that people are able to contribute in the order they wish.

## Guided writing process:
Navigate through slides, take questions before writing.  
Amount of time for each prompt:
* "I am": 5 min
* "In my practice, I": 5 min
* "I see resistance as": 7 min
* "I am concerned by": 7 min
* "I refuse"/"I want": 3 min each, do these BACK TO BACK with no discussion in between, and then discuss both together. Emphasize that this should be a laundry list of things rattled off one after the other.
* "I commit to": 3 min. These can be BIG commitments that are more conceptual, but also interested in small commitments that can be implemented tomorrow.

Set timer for designated minutes, play music while happening.  
Bring folks back to the group.

Have volunteers share what they wrote, and expand on it  
\** Ask folks to drop all references to artists, books, etc. into the chat so everyone has access to them. **  
Ask people if there's anything that anyone else shared that they wish to respond to.

## Manifesto writing
If time: discuss the manifesto - what people think its importance is  
Send collaborative document and note the translation of "I" to "we". Emphasize that now that we have talked about us as individuals, we are going to move into the collective through the compilation of things you saw as common ground, similar, thematically interesting.  
10 min to write collaboratively on shared document  
Bring everyone back, and talk through edits/additions. What was that experience like for everyone?
